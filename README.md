# AstroBox Pi 5 Community Fork

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is an unofficial, community-maintained fork of AstroBox, created to support the Raspberry Pi 5. It is *not* affiliated with AstroPrint or its developers.**

---

## üì¶ What is this?

This is a modified version of the official **AstroBox** image.  
The goal is to bring basic **Raspberry Pi 5 compatibility** to AstroBox, since there is no official image for the Pi 5 yet.

AstroPrint currently offers no support for this fork.  
However, if you're stuck or need help ‚Äì feel free to reach out to me!
I'll do my best to help fellow makers.

## üõ†Ô∏è How does it work?

The Raspberry Pi 5 uses a newer bootloader and kernel modules that aren't available in the original AstroBox image.  
To make it work:

- I copied the required **boot files** and **kernel modules (/lib/modules)** from a working **Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm)** image into the AstroBox image.
- Some minor config changes were made (e.g. `config.txt`, `cmdline.txt`) to ensure Pi 5 compatibility.

This method preserves the core functionality of AstroBox while unlocking Pi 5 support.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Hotspot mode is not working**  
  The AstroBox Hotspot (Access Point) fails to start properly on the Pi 5.  
  However, **WiFi, USB, and Ethernet are working fine**, so connecting to your local network is still possible.
